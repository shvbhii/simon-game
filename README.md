## üìù Project Description

This is a fully functional, web-based recreation of the classic electronic memory game, "Simon." The project serves as a deep dive into React's state management capabilities, handling complex game logic, timing, and user interaction entirely on the front end. It‚Äôs a fun, nostalgic game that challenges the player's memory with progressively longer sequences of colors and sounds.

### About the #30DaysOfVibeCoding Challenge

This project is an entry in my personal 30-day coding challenge. The goal is to rapidly build and deploy a new project every day, embracing a "vibe coding" philosophy. This approach leverages AI tools as creative collaborators to brainstorm ideas, generate complex logic, and solve problems, allowing me to stay in a state of creative flow and focus on bringing concepts to life.

## üåü Key Features

-   **Complex Game Logic:** A robust state machine (`start`, `watching`, `playing`, `gameover`) built with React hooks to manage the entire game flow.
-   **Dynamic Visual Feedback:** The pads light up in sequence and respond instantly to player clicks.
-   **Progressive Difficulty:** The sequence gets one step longer with each successful round, increasing the challenge.
-   **User-Friendly Instructions:** A pop-up modal clearly explains the rules of the game to new players.
-   **Component-Based Architecture:** The UI is cleanly separated into reusable components like `<ColorPad>`, `<InstructionsModal>`, and `<Footer>`.
-   **Polished UI/UX:** A clean, retro-inspired design with a central display for game status and score.

## üíª Tech Stack

-   **Frontend:** React.js, Vite
-   **Styling:** Pure CSS3 with CSS Grid for the main layout.
-   **Icons:** `react-icons` for modern, clean SVG icons.
-   **Core Logic:** JavaScript (`useState`, `useEffect`, `setTimeout`)
-   **Deployment:** Vercel
